When you enter your Terminal, create and activate a local environment for your game using the commands

      conda create -n rock-paper-scissors-env python=3.8

      conda activate rock-paper-scissors-env

Once you are in your new local environment, install the required functions in the required.txt file. You can do this by entering the command 

      pip install -r requirements.txt

into your command line.


Now you are ready to play the game! Enter

     python game.py

into your command line. 

If you would like to enter a username, right click on the left column and click "new file". Name the file ".env" and write

      USER_NAME = "Your Name"

Make sure your new user name is in the parenthesis. Save the file and you can continue to play the game.
